## Revenue Analytics
The report will be used to support the P&L Review as one of the requirements from our stakeholder, Corp. Consolidations.  The report will allow the Revenue Accounting team to investigate the revenue buckets/streams with a significant difference from the expected amount (which is based on the AUR from the last 12 months for HW and SU, and based on the average revenue from the last 12 months for SV) instead of validating the top customers.

### Summary Page
The purpose of this page is to see the summary of the Revenue Bucket for each Geo. Also, revenue differences that exceed 500k would be highlighted.

### Other Pages
There are 8 revenue buckets, each with its specific pages for revenue details, units, calculations, and analytics. It aids the drill down analysis into granular level.

### The Process
The stages below represent the end-to-end process of every BI project, which is consistent across other projects I've developed:
- Requirements Gathering: This phase involves gathering and documenting the specific requirements for the report.
- Creating Technical Specifications: Based on the requirements, technical specifications are created to outline how the report will be developed.
- Report Development: The actual development of the report takes place, including data integration, visualization creation, and dashboard design.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The report is tested by end users to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly.
- Deployment: Once the report passes UAT, it is deployed to the production environment for use by stakeholders.
- Maintenance: Ongoing maintenance and updates to the report are performed as needed to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.
